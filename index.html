    <h1 class="head">Laws of Seduction</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Don't tell them everything about yoursellf, be misterious. Put a spin on your stories to raise intrigue in womens mind.</li>
        <li>If they talk like dickhead reply like a dickhead. If they talk respectfully talk respectfully. Never show them they have emotionally affected you in anyway. Even if they even say you mean things, like ugly or shit just ignore them period.</li>
        <li>Don't talk about things that will make them feel ashamed of themself. Like things that they have done in past.</li>
        <li>Dont't smile and laugh too much on everything. Its beta thing to do.</li>
        <li>If she rejects you FTB (Fuck that bitch) don't try to push too much or act needy, cut your attention instantly. Example, when messaging leave her on read and don't reply to her until she replies.</li>
        <li>Women will start testing as soon as they start talking to you. Don't be emotionally affected at any point of conversation.</li>
        <li>Seduce women by making them the center of attention. Don't highlight own selves, but rather your entire focus is on bringing comfort and pleasure to your targets. You should avoid all sorts of conflict and appeal to a person's vanity by making them talk about themselves. Watch and observe and allow womens to open up completely. Once you know their weaknesses, use that information to give them what they want.</li>
        <li>Don't ask women to do something, instead tell them to do things, and apply rule: 5 if they don't comply. Once she says no for something, its fine don't start to bitch about that.</li>
    </ol>
